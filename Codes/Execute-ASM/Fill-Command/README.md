### Fill Command

A Code that basically emulates the /fill command from Java / BE

Usage

```
down arrow key + L = keyboard display

/copy = copy your coordinates

/fill---^^^^ Block ID

/fill x-coordinate y-coordinate z-coordinate

No block ID in case of destruction
```

Once again, I know it's not Execute ASM, but like I said - don't really care.
