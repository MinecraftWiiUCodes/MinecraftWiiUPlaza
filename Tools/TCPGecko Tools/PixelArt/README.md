# Minecraft: Wii U Pixel Art Tool
> by: MinecraftWiiUCodes

This tool allows you to paste any pixel art into your game, as long as the size is under 128x128, otherwise it may crash.
You are able to customize what colours are which blocks, and you are also able to change the size of the pixel art.
Requires you to be in Creative Mode for this to work.

## Color Presets
Color Presets can be saved and loaded, so you can share your own color preset for others to use.
There are some example ones in the /presets/ directory.

## Building Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 / 2022 (probably builds under older versions but latest is the safest bet)
- Windows 7 / 8(.1) / 10 / 11
- .NET Framework 4.8
